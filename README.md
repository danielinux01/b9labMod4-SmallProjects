B9Lab ETH19 Course Module 4, Splitter Smart Contract

You will create a smart contract named Splitter whereby:

there are 3 people: Alice, Bob and Carol
we can see the balance of the Splitter contract on the web page
whenever Alice sends ether to the contract, half of it goes to Bob and the other half to Carol
we can see the balances of Alice, Bob and Carol on the web page
we can send ether to it from the web page
It would be even better if you could team up with different people impersonating Alice, Bob and Carol, all cooperating on a test net.

Stretch goals:

add a kill switch to the whole contract
make the contract a utility that can be used by David, Emma and anybody with an address to split Ether between any 2 other addresses of their own choice
cover potentially bad input data
Do not:

split between more than 2 people
